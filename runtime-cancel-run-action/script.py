def run(metadata):
    """
    Cancels a running process identified by the provided RUN_ID.

    This function sends a cancellation request to the StackSpot Runtime Manager API
    to cancel a running process. The cancellation is forced by appending `?force=true`
    to the request URL.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    metadata : object
        An object containing the inputs for the function. It must include a 'run_id' key
        in the `inputs` dictionary, which holds the ULID of the run to be cancelled.

    Example:
    --------
    metadata = {
        'inputs': {
            'run_id': '01F8MECHZX3TBDSZ7XRADM79XE'
        }
    }
    run(metadata)

    The function will print the status of the cancellation request based on the response
    from the API.

    API Response Status Codes:
    --------------------------
    - 202: The run was successfully cancelled.
    - 404: The run was not found.
    - 422: The run is not currently running, so it cannot be aborted.
    - Other: Any other status code will be treated as an error, and the function will
      print the error details and exit the program.
